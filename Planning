For instance, road construction involves multiple stakeholders, NHAI being responsible for the roads till district headquarters, State PWD or Rural Development Department comes into the picture thereafter and BRO looks after border areas. Gati Shakti will help in the coordinated completion of roads at the same time, thereby providing seamless connectivity and opening various opportunities.

Similarly, though the creation of new or upgradation of existing Railway Station is the responsibility of the respective Division of Indian Railways, but the approach road comes under the ambit of the State government. The lack of coordination between the two executing bodies may result in the non-utilisation of newly created public infrastructure. Dynamic mapping of brownfield and greenfield projects on the Gati Shakti GIS Portal, with real-time updation, will provide visibility to implementing agencies to align their priorities properly.

Gati Shakti plan also aims to develop a nationwide network integrating digital systems of various ministries dealing with logistics under one platform known as ULIP (Unified Logistics Interface Platform) for facilitating minimal documentation, real-time information and faster movement of goods.
