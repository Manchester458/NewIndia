A recent paper by IMF on ‘Road Quality and Mean Speed Score’ ranked India 127th among 162 countries in terms of road transport speed. The US is the fastest country, with a mean speed score of 107 kmph, while India has a mean speed score of 58 kmph. Unsurprisingly India has high logistics costs of around 13-14 per cent of GDP as against 8-10 per cent in the US and Europe.

Reducing logistics costs is a sine qua non for India, where freight activity is expected to grow five-fold by 2050. India’s Logistics Ecosystem plays a critical role in achieving the national priorities of Atmanirbhar Bharat by ensuring quick, efficient, and economical transport of goods across India.
